# AutoLabel.jl

AutoLabel.jl is a Julia package that automatically adds appropriate axis labels to your 
PyPlot/PythonPlot plots using large language models.
This is more of a proof-of-concept than a fully-fledged package, but I do use it in my day-to-day plotting.

## Installation
To install AutoLabel.jl, since it's not yet registered in the Julia General Registry, you can install it directly from GitHub using:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/ajwheeler/AutoLabel.jl")
```

## Anthropic API key
AutoLabel.jl uses the Anthropic API to analyze your plotting code and provide labels. 
You'll need an API key from Anthropic to use this package.  Once you have your API key, you can 
make it available to AutoLabel.jl as an environment variable named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, by, e.g.

1. Adding it to your shell's startup file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
2. Setting it in your Julia session:
   ```julia
   ENV["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

# To use
AutoLabel.jl is designed to work with Jupyter notebooks. To use it, just import the package 
(`using AutoLabel`), and add `#labels` as the last line of any code cell.  When you execute, that 
line will be replaced by LLM-generated code, which will be run the next time you execute the 
cell.  

!!! note
    AutoLabel inserts LLM-generated code into your notebook cells. Read autogenerated code before executing it.
